# AffectiveVR â€“ **results**

    Last update:    December 13, 2023
    Status:         in preparation


## Description of results

This directory contains the results of phase 1 and phase 2 of the AVR project but also results from the open-source datasets CASE, CEAP and EmoCompass (see [README_code.md](../code/AVR/README_code.md) for a detailed description of these datasets). The AVR results reside in a directory called `./results/phase1/` and `./results/phase2/`. Additionally to descriptive summary statistics, results of the change point analysis of each dataset can be found in the respective subfolder.

## Data visualization

In each of the change point analysis subfolders for each dataset, plots displaying the time series (of the continuous rating data or of a physiological signal) and the identified change points can be found. Additionally, comparisons of different datasets have also been plotted.

## Statistics
Change points still need to be tested for significance using permutation tests. Summary statistics for each dataset will be calculated separately.
