# AffectiveVR – **results**

## Description of results

This directory contains the results of the Selection, the Evaluation, and the Physio phase of the AVR project. However, most of the results from the Selection and Evaluation phase have not been found by me but by Antonin Fourcade. As my thesis focuses on the Physio phase, results from that phase are most prominent here and can be found in `./results/phase3/AVR`. There, results for all subjects are listed separately, as well as averaged across all subjects. Some of the result plots are shown below.
