Unit test package for AVR

To run all tests, run the following command from the root directory:

```shell
    pytest .                # (standard run through the tests)
        --cov               # (check how much (%) of the code is tested already)
        --cov-report=html   # (to explore which parts of the code are not tested yet).
```"""
